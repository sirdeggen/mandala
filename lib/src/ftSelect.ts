/**
 * Token-aware UTXO (coin) selection.
 *
 * Mirrors the wallet-toolbox change-allocation strategy
 * (StorageKnex.allocateChangeInput / generateChange) but selects on the token
 * amount carried by each FT output rather than on satoshis:
 *
 *   Prefer CONFIRMED outputs entirely; only dip into unconfirmed ones when the
 *   confirmed balance cannot cover the target. Within a pool, allocate one input
 *   at a time against the remaining target:
 *     1. exact match  — an output whose amount equals the remainder (oldest first)
 *     2. overfund least — the smallest output ≥ the remainder (oldest first);
 *                          taking it satisfies the target in a single UTXO
 *     3. largest below — the largest output < the remainder (newest first), then
 *                          loop for the rest
 *   This keeps the input count low (a single covering output wins) and spends
 *   confirmed, older coins first.
 *
 * `order` is a relative age rank (lower = older), derived from listActions
 * position by the loader. Ties in step 3 take the newest to mirror the toolbox's
 * `orderBy outputId desc`.
